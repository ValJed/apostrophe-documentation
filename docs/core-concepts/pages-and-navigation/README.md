# Pages and Navigation

At its root, any website is a series of pages, containing content and applications, connected through navigation. Maybe a site is a single page with a blog, or maybe it's 100s of complex pages integrated with a web application for online shopping. Either way, it all starts with pages, and how use them to connect users with content.
